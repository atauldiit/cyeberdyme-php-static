        <h2>Disaster Recovery Solutions </h2>
        <p>What would happen if one day all your business data was gone? Unforeseeable events such as fires, hardware failures or theft happen every day to businesses. The key to a successful recovery will be determined by how prepared you are today.</p>
<p>Cyberdyme makes backing up your valuable business data easy. Different from a standard file backup, the Disaster Recovery Solution backs up a mirror image of your entire computer and/ or server, including the operating system and software. Standard file backups can take days to rebuild and could be incomplete, but with an image backup the recovery takes only hours and is 100% complete
